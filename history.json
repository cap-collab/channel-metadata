St Germain were faithful to the deeper shades of the Chicago source material, and producers like Pépé Bradock used samples to take listeners on intricately arranged and psychedelic dancefloor journeys. \nAspects of French Touch's history have been purposefully omitted from this two hour mix for the sake of brevity, namely the scene's origins in France's hip hop scene, (Philippe Zdar and DJ Mehdi both produced for legendary French rapper MC Solaar) and French Touch's \"second wave\" in the mid-2000s, spearheaded by Busy P's Ed Banger Records label, and artists such as Justice.",
