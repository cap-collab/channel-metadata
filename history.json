It was renowned for the quality of its recordings (most of which were recorded by engineer Yoshihiko Kannari), and its incredible artwork. \nIn this third episode of our Japanese Jazz Week series, we’ll hear many of the label’s artists, including Isao Suzki, Kosuke Mine, & Masaru Imada.\n今回はジャズレーベル『スリー・ブラインド・マイス』特集です。『スリー・ブラインド・マイス』は、藤井武らによって、日本の新進気鋭の演奏者たちを世に出すことを目指して1970年6月に設立��れた日本のジャズ専門レーベルで、時には「日本のBlue Note」と形容されることも。スタジオエンジニアのYoshihiko Kannariによる高いレコーディング技術や、美しいアートワークによって注目されてきました。\n第3回となる今回は、『スリー・ブラインド・マイス』の鈴木勲、峰厚介、今田勝他さまざまなのアーティストの曲をお届けします。Translated by Satoko Akune.",

After gaining global popularity, boleros paved the way for the filin movement in Havana - a word derived from feeling, describing a style of post-microphone jazz-influenced romantic song.\nThis Guide To covers the most romantic exitos of the genres bolero and filin, crooners for the month of love.",

In the early 2000s he was exposed to the genre primarily through Dieselboy and Danny The Wildchild mixes as well as the “Jungle Book” series of mixtapes. He became obsessed after hearing Bad Company’s “The Nine” and “Four Days,” as well as Pendulum’s “Vault.” \r\n\r\nAs time went on, he got deeper into the scene, going to raves while buying records and posting on Drum & Bass Arena and DNBForum before turning 21 at which point he began going to Lava Lounge for Bass By The Pound’s “Seminar” series. The first legal drum & bass party he attended was Chase & Status at the aforementioned Lava Lounge, and he will never forget the energy when the duo played DJ Hazard’s “Killers Don’t Die” and it got a rewind. His love for the scene led to him playing drum & bass parties, opening for artists like Original Sin, Gridlok, and LTJ Bukem among others. \r\n\r\nHis Subtle Radio show is an hour of the finest tunes in the scene at the moment. \r\n\r\nTo keep up, follow @djsoundarkitek on Instagram!",
