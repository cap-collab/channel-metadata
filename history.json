His music contrasts the reality of our world with what’s beyond, and explores questions of movement, migration, alienation and belonging. His releases include Works In Metal, Here Lies Universality, Unsettling Scores, and The Open Boat. Fofana is the founder of the imprint Black Studies and phase4.zip\nFrom the host: _\"A one-hour selection of closing tracks and exit music from Prince to Lubomyr Melnyk; from a somber reflection on black refusal and resisting closure to a triumphant and utterly sublime solo piano work, this show observes the lost art of the last song with pairings and contributions from Toumani Diabaté and Kayhan Kalhor, Rokia Traoré and Oumou Sangaré, Amina Alaoui and Abdullah Ibrahim, Shabaka and James Newton.\nThe show concludes with a live acoustic rendition of \"Reflection\" by Prince, accompanied by Wendy Melvoin of the Revolution, a particularly poignant track from his late career landmark album Musicology. Below is a link to a video of the performance on The Tavis Smiley Show from February 2004\"_",
