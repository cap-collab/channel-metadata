It was renowned for the quality of its recordings (most of which were recorded by engineer Yoshihiko Kannari), and its incredible artwork. \nIn this third episode of our Japanese Jazz Week series, we’ll hear many of the label’s artists, including Isao Suzki, Kosuke Mine, & Masaru Imada.\n今回はジャズレーベル『スリー・ブラインド・マイス』特集です。『スリー・ブラインド・マイス』は、藤井武らによって、日本の新進気鋭の演奏者たちを世に出すことを目指して1970年6月に設立��れた日本のジャズ専門レーベルで、時には「日本のBlue Note」と形容されることも。スタジオエンジニアのYoshihiko Kannariによる高いレコーディング技術や、美しいアートワークによって注目されてきました。\n第3回となる今回は、『スリー・ブラインド・マイス』の鈴木勲、峰厚介、今田勝他さまざまなのアーティストの曲をお届けします。Translated by Satoko Akune.",

After gaining global popularity, boleros paved the way for the filin movement in Havana - a word derived from feeling, describing a style of post-microphone jazz-influenced romantic song.\nThis Guide To covers the most romantic exitos of the genres bolero and filin, crooners for the month of love.",

With their minds altered thanks to smuggled records by Fripp & Eno or Steve Reich, this loose network of musicians had begun composing meditative music, using loops and handmade instruments, with a different sensibility. Compared to the boisterous Zappa-adjacent and booze-soaked underground movement, which was led by Plastic People of the Universe and provoked the state authorities, this music was meant instead for tea rooms and spiritual sites like churches or monasteries, as if occupying some place where time flows anticlockwise. Music journalist Pavel Klusák dubbed this 1990s scene a “tearoom alternative”. Experimental folk singer Oldřich Janota, Jaroslav Kořán’s various ensembles like Modrá or Orloj Snivců (The Horologe of Dreamers) or Irena and Vojtěch Havlovi were drawn by the light and composed music that didn’t match the fast pace of newly imported capitalism.\nMix created by: Miloš Hroch",

Presented by 鹽埕區長 Salt District Mayor — an audiovisual archive and label devoted to Taiwanese roots music — the mix was originally recorded for my monthly Taiwanese Music History Book Club at Chao Bar. Our September session explored Jeph Lo’s ALTERing NATIVism: Sound Cultures in Post-War Taiwan, and I was especially moved by the chapter on banned songs.\nThis set gathers those silenced voices — from banned songs and protest anthems to ballads of belonging and hope — tracing Taiwan’s long tradition of using music as a tool for social change. Across Mandarin, Taiwanese Hokkien, and Hakka languages, the mix journeys from campus-folk awakenings and labor anthems to Indigenous blues and anti-nuclear protest songs. Each record is a reminder that peace is not the absence of noise, but the courage to keep singing.\nNote: The live mix recorded at Chao Bar was around 40min, so I added a few more tracks digitized from my vinyl collection to extend the mix to an hour length. The Chao Bar mix was also taped on video, so if interested, I could cut a few clips for NTS Radio to share on instagram. Thank you for your time and this opportunity!",

I become so fixated on its relaxing and hypnotic beauty that it became this paradise of sound that I returned to again and again.\nIn the late 1950’s, Martin Denny ditched his orchestral, Big Band sound to create what would be known as the “Exotica” genre. Combining the music of lounge jazz with tropical flavors from the Hawaiian & Caribbean islands, he birthed something uniquely experiential for its time. While it was despised by critics during its era, it became a hit within tiki bars and beach side resorts, it later brought about a cult following. Other artists in Denny’s circle joined and made it in their own vision. With the sounds of bird calls, animals howling, and ocean waves crashing, you get a cinematic experience with every song.

A space where I encourage myself and others to share little delicate, painful, hidden, perhaps even forgotten pieces of themselves, play records that we usually don't have the chance to, due to some social pressure or setting. It is genre defying, complex and cathartic. Raw Kernels focuses on expressing heartfelt connection with music through playful and intricate mixing. My own oasis. \nI hope to transmit a feeling of peace through this medium. I hope you feel it. It's not perfect, it's raw! From TwoFace's lil room with Love. Thank you for listening. :)",

But it was his later music—like the album Ancient Ritual, which marked Simmons’s reemergence after more than a decade of poverty, addiction, and obscurity—that cemented his signature spirit of survival. \nSelected by Lawrence Kumpf of Blank Forms, upon the publication of Simmons’s memoir Better Do It Now Before You Die Later.

In the early 2000s he was exposed to the genre primarily through Dieselboy and Danny The Wildchild mixes as well as the “Jungle Book” series of mixtapes. He became obsessed after hearing Bad Company’s “The Nine” and “Four Days,” as well as Pendulum’s “Vault.” \r\n\r\nAs time went on, he got deeper into the scene, going to raves while buying records and posting on Drum & Bass Arena and DNBForum before turning 21 at which point he began going to Lava Lounge for Bass By The Pound’s “Seminar�� series. The first legal drum & bass party he attended was Chase & Status at the aforementioned Lava Lounge, and he will never forget the energy when the duo played DJ Hazard’s “Killers Don’t Die” and it got a rewind. His love for the scene led to him playing drum & bass parties, opening for artists like Original Sin, Gridlok, and LTJ Bukem among others. \r\n\r\nHis Subtle Radio show is an hour of the finest tunes in the scene at the moment. \r\n\r\nTo keep up, follow @djsoundarkitek on Instagram!",

In the early 2000s he was exposed to the genre primarily through Dieselboy and Danny The Wildchild mixes as well as the “Jungle Book” series of mixtapes. He became obsessed after hearing Bad Company’s “The Nine” and “Four Days,” as well as Pendulum’s “Vault.” \r\n\r\nAs time went on, he got deeper into the scene, going to raves while buying records and posting on Drum & Bass Arena and DNBForum before turning 21 at which point he began going to Lava Lounge for Bass By The Pound’s “Seminar” series. The first legal drum & bass party he attended was Chase & Status at the aforementioned Lava Lounge, and he will never forget the energy when the duo played DJ Hazard’s “Killers Don’t Die” and it got a rewind. His love for the scene led to him playing drum & bass parties, opening for artists like Original Sin, Gridlok, and LTJ Bukem among others. \r\n\r\nHis Subtle Radio show is an hour of the finest tunes in the scene at the moment. \r\n\r\nTo keep up, follow @djsoundarkitek on Instagram!",
