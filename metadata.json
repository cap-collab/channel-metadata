Presented by 鹽埕區長 Salt District Mayor — an audiovisual archive and label devoted to Taiwanese roots music — the mix was originally recorded for my monthly Taiwanese Music History Book Club at Chao Bar. Our September session explored Jeph Lo’s ALTERing NATIVism: Sound Cultures in Post-War Taiwan, and I was especially moved by the chapter on banned songs.\nThis set gathers those silenced voices — from banned songs and protest anthems to ballads of belonging and hope — tracing Taiwan’s long tradition of using music as a tool for social change. Across Mandarin, Taiwanese Hokkien, and Hakka languages, the mix journeys from campus-folk awakenings and labor anthems to Indigenous blues and anti-nuclear protest songs. Each record is a reminder that peace is not the absence of noise, but the courage to keep singing.\nNote: The live mix recorded at Chao Bar was around 40min, so I added a few more tracks digitized from my vinyl collection to extend the mix to an hour length. The Chao Bar mix was also taped on video, so if interested, I could cut a few clips for NTS Radio to share on instagram. Thank you for your time and this opportunity!",
