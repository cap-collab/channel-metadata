A space where I encourage myself and others to share little delicate, painful, hidden, perhaps even forgotten pieces of themselves, play records that we usually don't have the chance to, due to some social pressure or setting. It is genre defying, complex and cathartic. Raw Kernels focuses on expressing heartfelt connection with music through playful and intricate mixing.
