In the early 2000s he was exposed to the genre primarily through Dieselboy and Danny The Wildchild mixes as well as the “Jungle Book” series of mixtapes. He became obsessed after hearing Bad Company’s “The Nine” and “Four Days,” as well as Pendulum’s “Vault.” \r\n\r\nAs time went on, he got deeper into the scene, going to raves while buying records and posting on Drum & Bass Arena and DNBForum before turning 21 at which point he began going to Lava Lounge for Bass By The Pound’s “Seminar” series. The first legal drum & bass party he attended was Chase & Status at the aforementioned Lava Lounge, and he will never forget the energy when the duo played DJ Hazard’s “Killers Don’t Die” and it got a rewind. His love for the scene led to him playing drum & bass parties, opening for artists like Original Sin, Gridlok, and LTJ Bukem among others. \r\n\r\nHis Subtle Radio show is an hour of the finest tunes in the scene at the moment. \r\n\r\nTo keep up, follow @djsoundarkitek on Instagram!",
