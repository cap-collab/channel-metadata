With their forthcoming work, yeule paints us a picture with divine poise: fragmented shards of their persona non grata, or \"darker side,\" pieced together as the painterly fatale who burns through the canvas of post-modernity. With visual artworks captured by artist Vasso Vu, Ćmiel is seen here tethered to their role as a \"painter\" before performer. yeule, reincarnated again as a haunting facsimile of their past in Evangelic Girl is a Gun.
