The band reforms, they tour, and they start making new music.\nThe path of '90s slowcore and space rock band Duster is perhaps the prime example of this story playing out in real life. Their first two records Stratosphere and Contemporary Movement were re-discovered and re-appraised after exploding in popularity on TikTok, where their fuzz-fogged lo-fi soundscapes were soundtracking the lives of new Gen Z fans. \nThis In Focus highlights Duster's best material, from their first era, and their new records released since their reformation.
