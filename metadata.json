Imagine a Zen Buddhist with unresolved emotional issues. For me, thats how this particular \"vibe\" relates to minimal or formal aesthetics.\" - Mark Fell",

After gaining global popularity, boleros paved the way for the filin movement in Havana - a word derived from feeling, describing a style of post-microphone jazz-influenced romantic song.\nThis Guide To covers the most romantic exitos of the genres bolero and filin, crooners for the month of love.",
