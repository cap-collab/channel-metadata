I become so fixated on its relaxing and hypnotic beauty that it became this paradise of sound that I returned to again and again.\nIn the late 1950’s, Martin Denny ditched his orchestral, Big Band sound to create what would be known as the “Exotica” genre. Combining the music of lounge jazz with tropical flavors from the Hawaiian & Caribbean islands, he birthed something uniquely experiential for its time. While it was despised by critics during its era, it became a hit within tiki bars and beach side resorts, it later brought about a cult following. Other artists in Denny’s circle joined and made it in their own vision. With the sounds of bird calls, animals howling, and ocean waves crashing, you get a cinematic experience with every song. This mix is a curated journey through this forgotten time in music. Welcome back to paradise.",
