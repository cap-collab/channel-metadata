But it was his later music—like the album Ancient Ritual, which marked Simmons’s reemergence after more than a decade of poverty, addiction, and obscurity—that cemented his signature spirit of survival. \nSelected by Lawrence Kumpf of Blank Forms, upon the publication of Simmons’s memoir Better Do It Now Before You Die Later.
