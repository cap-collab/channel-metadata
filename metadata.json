Throughout our time doing God Colony we've always looked for unusual collaborations, be it rappers like Flohio or PS Hitsquad, solo artists like Mykki Blanco and Bobby Gillespie… So, we asked Adam if he'd like to work on a collaborative mix with us.

Few musicians in 21st Century have diffused their influence throughout pop music and beyond as inexorably as SOPHIE. \nShe created sounds that tore music – and by extension her own identity – down to its molecular constituents, alchemising them to thrilling effect, in a way that spellbound both the avant-garde and the poptimists alike. Since her passing, her devoted fanbase remains as active as ever, cataloging and archive SOPHIE's vast discography of officially and unofficially released music. \nSelected and mixed by Jennifer Walton.
