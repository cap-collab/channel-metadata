The label was instrumental in releasing records from some of the region's most prominent musicians during the golden age of African music.\nMany of the artists signed to Albarika Records were known for blending indigenous African rhythms with Western jazz, funk, and soul influences. This made their sound distinctive and part of a broader movement across West Africa during the 60s and 70s, as music became a form of social and political expression.",

Dismayed by this news, she turned to religion, becoming an Orthodox nun, taking the title \"Emahoy\" and changing to the religious name Tsegué Mariam.\nShe spent the rest of her years living out these holy orders, first in Addis, and eventually in Jerusalem, where she continued to write and record music – a truly singular style of piano composition, as indebted to the proto-ambience of Erik Satie as it is to the Ethiopian tradition. \nThis mix, selected by NTS, features recordings from \"Church of Kidane Mehret\", a new archival release from Mississippi Records, including previously unheard material.",
