        "d": "“I start associating your voice with ….”, for a while ML has been part of the NTS community, jingling around, airing his monthly 150 Session out of Berlin’s North, where all seasons give reasons. For clarification, creation, inspiration. One hour of poetic and musical explorations, questions, and curiosities. Circling around daring electronics, ethno-sonics, jazz-constructivism, minimalism, open structured digital dopamine, risky dub excitement and other sounds, that still need to be written. No country, no flag – outernational without a cause!\nFrom the host: \"The first 150 Session in 2026 is dedicated to guitar and trumpet player Günter Schickert, who passed shortly before Christmas. The world darlings his kraut-historic solo work “Samtvogel”, it will echo forever. Here some rather unheard sides, showcasing his spiritual experimental reverberations.\"",
