        "d": "Mexican-American producer, composer and DJ Debit takes over as part of a Modern Love Takeover.\n\"This show traces how cumbia rebajada shaped a broad field of electronic practice. The slow and pitched down technique that emerged in Monterrey through Sonido Dueñez altered meter, weight and feeling. Its influence surfaces in dub oriented edits, digital and post digital cumbia, regional vaporwave, experimental hybrids and South Texas approaches to edits and appropriations like chopped cumbia and DJ Screw’s fx dialogue with southern hip hop. These forms center time manipulation, bass pressure, repetition and the local tools people use to reshape inherited music. The set moves across multiple regions and roughly a decade of production, showing a magical exchange of methods where the cumbia rhythm becomes a shared terrain for Latin American electronic sound content and form.\"",

To carry out the job of expanding human consciousness for prospective and practicing new agers across the world, Sutphen recruited a crew of unlikely electronic journeymen brought together by cosmic energies and starcrossed circumstances. Like satellites pulled into orbit by the immense gravity of his psychic magnetism, core-producers David Naegele, David Storrs, Steven Cooper, and Robert Slap, would receive Sutphen’s message and mass communicate it back to Earth.",
